# ANSYS-Fatigue-Cohesive-Element
This repository contains a subroutine for an ANSYS Mechanical APDL cohesive element for the modelling of multiple delamination quasi-static and fatigue onset/initiation and propagation. The subroutine also calculates the J-integral in the cohesive zone. Test cases are also included showcasing these capabilities.
