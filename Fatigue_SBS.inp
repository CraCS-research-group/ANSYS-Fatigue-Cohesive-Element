!%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% MODEL DESCRIPTION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
!
! This is an ANSYS Mechanical APDL input file to run a fatigue analysis of a Short Beam Shear model with user-defined cohesive elements
!
!%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% PARAMETERS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
!
! Parameters
st_time_substepqs = 0.1 ! 0.025 ! Starting time substep for quasi-static loading step
max_time_substepqs = 0.1 ! 0.025 ! Maximum time substep for quasi-static loading step
NumCycles = 10E4 ! Total number of cycles to be simulated
IncTargetCycles = 10 ! Target of cycles per substep to be simulated
Totala = 10.0! Total crack growth to be simulated
IncTargeta = 0.05 ! Target of crack growth per substep to be simulated
! In this case, the target given is in terms of crack growth and not of number of cycles
st_time_substepf = IncTargeta/Totala ! Starting time substep for quasi-static loading step
max_time_substepf =IncTargeta/Totala ! Maximum time substep for quasi-static loading step
!
! The following material properties are defined in "Tao, C., Mukhopadhyay, S., Zhang, B., Kawashita, L. F., Qiu, J., Hallett, S. R. (2018). 
! An improved delamination fatigue cohesive interface model for complex three-dimensional multi-interface cases. 
! Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing, 107, 633–646. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2018.02.008"
! Except for:
! - The mode mixity Paris law parameters, which are from "Trabal, G. G., Bak, B. L. V., Chen, B., Carreras, L., Lindgaard, E. (2022). 
! An adaptive floating node based formulation for the analysis of multiple delaminations under high cycle fatigue loading.
! - The penalty stiffness, as determined in a convergence analysis for the DNS case.
! - The mode II interface strength, which is modified to better match the experimental static failure stress to the prediction by the 
! finite element model in a quasi-static simulation. This adjustment is done to guarantee that the application of the experimental 
! loads in the numerical analysis corresponds to a similar level of severity, which is defined as the ratio between the applied shear 
! stress and the static failure shear stress. The strength is increased from 90 MPa, in Tao et al., to 95 MPa to raise the numerically 
! predicted failure stress from 90.7 MPa to 104.6 MPa. The experimental static failure stress was 103.2 MPa.
